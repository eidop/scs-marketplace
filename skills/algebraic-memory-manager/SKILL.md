# Algebraic Memory Manager Skill

This skill provides advanced capabilities for managing and interacting with your memory and data using algebraic principles.

## Core Functionality

- **Dynamic Memory Retrieval/Storage:** Utilizes algebraic rules or conditions to determine what information to store, when to retrieve it, and how to process it.
- **Contextual Calculation:** Performs real-time calculations based on current session context or external data, informing memory operations or triggering other skills.
- **Rule-Based Decision Making:** Implements logical constructs (e.g., if-then-else, inequalities) to govern information handling, ensuring intelligent utilization of memories based on quantitative rules.

## Usage Examples

- **Prioritizing tasks:** Automatically assign urgency scores based on project deadlines and resource availability.
- **Filtering data:** Retrieve only relevant memories that meet specific numerical thresholds or conditions.
- **Triggering actions:** Initiate other skills or processes when calculated values reach predefined levels.

## Automation

This skill is designed to work in conjunction with other skills and cron jobs, providing an algorithmic layer for decision-making and data management.
