# Advanced Code & Logic Skill

This skill provides sophisticated capabilities for all programming and logical challenges.

## Core Functionality

- **Code Generation:** Write scripts, functions, or full programs in specified languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Bash).
- **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Identify and resolve errors in existing code, provide explanations for issues.
- **Code Refactoring & Optimization:** Improve code readability, efficiency, and maintainability.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Design and implement complex algorithms and data structures.
- **API Integration:** Generate boilerplate and guidance for integrating with various APIs.

## Usage Examples

- "Write a Python script to parse CSV data."
- "Debug this JavaScript function for an array sorting error."
- "Refactor this C# class for better performance."
- "Explain the logic of a quicksort algorithm."
- "Generate boilerplate for a REST API call in Node.js."

## Resources

- `scripts/`: Placeholder for reusable code utilities (e.g., `formatter.py`, `linter.js`).
- `references/`: Placeholder for language-specific documentation, common design patterns, or debugging techniques.
