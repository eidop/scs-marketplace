# Discord Client Websites Setup

## Channel: #client-websites

**Purpose:** Dedicated space for client website projects with Anders

---

## Channel Description
```
🎯 Client Website Development
===========================

This channel is for building websites for clients using automation (n8n).
ANDERS ONLY: Direct replies for client work.
You (Eido): Approve builds, manage clients.

Use thread per client project:
- Real Estate / Investment / Customer Service / Accounting / Healthcare / Recruitment
- Anders builds → You approve → Client receives final site

See templates/verticals-complete.md for full specs.
```

- **Response rate:** Fast (within 2 hours during work hours)
- **Updates:** Weekly progress updates in thread
- **Blockers:** DM Eido immediately if scope unclear

## Workflow

**New client request:**
1. Client asks in main channel → You create thread in #client-websites
2. Fill in template with client details
3. Anders' bot acknowledges and starts work
4. Weekly updates posted by Anders' bot
5. You review and approve
6. Deploy to client

**Questions from client:**
- Client DMs you → You add context to thread → Anders replies
- Anders DMs you → You forward to client thread (if appropriate)

**Approval process:**
1. Anders marks "Ready for review" in thread
2. You test everything
3. You give final approval
4. You send to client (or Anders sends if configured)

---

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Use thread for every client project
- Include full specs (features, automations, timeline)
- Have Anders update weekly
- Approve before client sees anything
- Log all decisions in thread

**DON'T:**
- Discuss unrelated client work in other channels
- Have Anders reply to client DMs directly (always through you)
- Change scope without updating thread
- Skip weekly updates
