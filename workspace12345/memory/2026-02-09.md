## Session Summary
Merged workspace structure, created shared memory system, set up automated vault with categorized keys.

## Memory Structure
- Shared `MEMORY.md` at workspace root
- Daily logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Synchronized across workspaces

## Vault System
- Categorized keys: models, apis, apps, services, secrets
- Automated rotation: `auto-rotate.js`
- Auto-load on session start: `load-vault.js`

## Decisions
- Use shared memory across all workspaces for continuity
- Create new workspace for each major project/client
- Keep vault in workspace, never commit to public repo

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Fine-tune Ollama model for SCS/Eido (18:30 reminder)
- [ ] Set up rotation reasons in `rotation-reasons.json`
- [ ] Merge multiple workspace folders into one
- [ ] Create subfolder structure (SCS, Client-Projects, Dev-Tools)
