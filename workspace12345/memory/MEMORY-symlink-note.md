# Memory

_This file is a symlink to the main memory location._

**Note:** For efficiency, you should symlink this to the shared memory location.

**Example:**
```bash
# In workspace12345
ln -s ../../.openclaw/MEMORY.md MEMORY.md
```

**Alternatively:** Keep `MEMORY.md` in this folder and sync it with the main location periodically.
